But their plan did not come to fruition. Captured and detained by Yemeni authorities, the approximately 600 men now await deportation, prevented from leaving their makeshift prison by armed soldiers. Conditions in the warehouse are becoming increasingly desperate. Several days ago, authorities stopped distributing food and basic supplies. ""I came from Djibouti to work. They used to give us small amounts of food. If there is no food, we will die,"" said a migrant who refused to give his name. ""If there is no solution, they will deport us to our countries or take us out of here,"" added the man. Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa, many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence. The route was already dangerous long before Yemen plunged into total war in 2015. Hundreds die each year on the perilous sea journey, and those who make it face multiple risks, including death from ""assault, extortion, and abuse by criminal networks, as well as the dangers arising from the war in Yemen itself,"" according to UNHCR, the United Nations refugee agency. Despite these dangers, the number of migrants traveling through the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea to Yemen has been steadily increasing, from 92,000 in 2015 to 117,000 in 2016, according to UNHCR. Khaled al-Elwany, a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants to their home countries, says that up to 15,000 migrants are arrested at checkpoints in the city each month. Elwany says he was fired by the Ministry of Interior for refusing to cooperate with a plan to move the center to a neighboring province and after authorities stopped the food supply. An official from the ministry told Reuters that the goal of moving to a new facility was to improve conditions for migrants while awaiting deportation. Saudi Arabia and a coalition primarily made up of Arab Gulf allies are fighting to restore Yemen's exiled government to power and curb the Houthi movement aligned with Iran. While the government nominally controls Aden and other areas in the south, the lack of budget and rivalries with local armed groups mean that its officials reside mainly abroad. State services and salaries have been severely affected by the chaos, and African migrants appear to be a lower priority. The frightened men in the warehouse in Aden, who survive on bread bought with meager savings and wash their clothes in an outdoor space full of garbage, are just the tip of the iceberg.",1
